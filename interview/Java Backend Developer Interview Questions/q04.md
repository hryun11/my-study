Garbage collection in Java is the process of automatically reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer needed or referenced by the program. The Java runtime environment manages memory automatically, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than manually allocating and freeing memory.

Here's a simplified overview of how garbage collection works in Java:

Marking: The garbage collector starts by identifying objects that are still in use and marking them as "reachable." It begins with a set of known root objects, such as local variables, static fields, and active threads.

Tracing: Starting from the root objects, the garbage collector traverses object references and marks all reachable objects as live. This process continues recursively until all reachable objects are marked.

Sweeping: Once all live objects are marked, the garbage collector sweeps through the memory, identifying and reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are not marked as live. The memory is then freed and made available for future use.

Compacting (optional): In some garbage collection algorithms, an additional step called compaction is performed. It involves moving the live objects closer together in memory, effectively reducing fragmentation and optimizing memory usage.

Java employs different garbage collection algorithms, with the most commonly used one being the generational garbage collection. It divides the heap memory into several generations based on the age of objects, typically including young, old, and permanent generations. Each generation has its own garbage collection strategy and is collected at different intervals.

Young Generation: Newly created objects are allocated in the young generation. Garbage collection in the young generation, called minor collection, is usually performed frequently. It utilizes a copying algorithm called the "Copying Collector," which moves live objects to a different area of memory, leaving the old space empty.

Old Generation: Objects that survive several minor collections are promoted to the old generation. Garbage collection in the old generation, called major collection or full collection, is less frequent and more time-consuming than minor collection. It uses different algorithms like the "Mark-Sweep" or "Mark-Sweep-Compact" to free memory.

Permanent Generation (prior to Java 8): This generation stores metadata about the classes and methods in the JVM, as well as interned strings. It is not involved in regular object allocation or garbage collection. In Java 8 and later versions, the permanent generation was replaced by the "Metaspace."

The garbage collector runs in the background, pausing the execution of the application threads when necessary to perform garbage collection. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) determines when and how garbage collection is triggered based on factors like available memory, object allocation rate, and other heuristics.

It's worth noting that Java provides some options to control garbage collection behavior, such as different garbage collector configurations, tuning parameters, and even manual memory management in certain cases.
